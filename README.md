<!-- MDOC !-->

Plug that makes POST and PATCH requests idempotent using `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header.

Follows the [IETF Idempotency-Key HTTP Header Field specification draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/).

<!-- MDOC !-->

## Installation

Add `idempotency_plug` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:idempotency_plug, "~> 0.2"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

First, add the request tracker to your supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  # ..

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {IdempotencyPlug.RequestTracker, [name: MyAppWeb.RequestTracker]}
      # ...
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor)
  end
end
```

Now add the plug to your pipeline:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
  # ...

  pipeline :api do
    plug :accepts, ["json"]
    plug IdempotencyPlug, tracker: MyAppWeb.RequestTracker
  end

  # ...
end
```

All POST and PATCH requests will now be idempotent using the `Idempotency-Key` HTTP header value, storing responses with the default ETS store.

### Persisted store

The ETS store is not persisted, so it's not production ready. Instead, let's change the store to use Ecto.

First, run `mix idempotency_plug.ecto.gen.migration`.

Now update the configuration for the request tracker:

```elixir
{IdempotencyPlug.RequestTracker, [store: {IdempotencyPlug.EctoStore, repo: MyApp.Repo}]}
```

You can also implement your own idempotent request store by using the behaviour in `IdempotencyPlug.Store`.

## Scope `Idempotency-Key`

If you are authenticating users then you must scope the `Idempotency-Key` to the authenticated user:

```elixir
plug IdempotencyPlug,
  tracker: MyAppWeb.RequestTracker,
  idempotency_key: {__MODULE__, :scope_idempotency_key}

def scope_idempotency_key(conn, key), do: {conn.assigns.current_user.id, key}
```

Otherwise, you may have a security vulnerability (or conflict) where any user can access another user's cached responses when requests are identical.

## Customize error response

By default, errors are raised and handled by the `Plug.Exception` protocol, but you can handle the errors by setting the `:with` option:

```elixir
plug IdempotencyPlug,
  tracker: MyAppWeb.RequestTracker,
  with: {__MODULE__, :handle_error}

def handle_error(conn, error) do
  conn
  |> put_status(Plug.Exception.status(error))
  |> json(%{error: error.message})
  |> halt()
end
```

## Phoenix tests

For your controller tests, you may want to add this helper to set up the idempotency key:

```elixir
def setup_with_idempotency_key(%{conn: conn}) do
  conn = Plug.Conn.put_req_header(conn, "idempotency-key", Ecto.UUID.bingenerate())

  {:ok, conn: conn}
end
```

```elixir
setup :setup_with_idempotency_key
```

This ensures that all the tests succeed by generating a UUID for all requests.
